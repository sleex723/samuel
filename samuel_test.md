In my previous job, I made some *very minor* changes on html (changing fonts, colors, text, etc.) and it caught my interest.  I decided to give it a shot and began to read about HTML/CSS online.

The ultimate goal that I hope to achieve from Makerprep is to ~~just learn how to code~~ get into the MakerSquare immersive program.
